# Executive Summary
*This section provides an overview of the project. It should briefly touch on the motivation, data question, data to be used, along with any known assumptions and challenges.*

As a teacher, I have some first-hand knowledge of the strengths – as well as the weaknesses – of Nashville’s school system, Metro Nashville Public Schools (MNPS). One of the reasons I chose the school I currently work at is because it’s one of the few truly diverse schools in Nashville – both racially and socioeconomically. Even so, over the years, our student demographics have been shifting, and there are many possible factors as to why that could be. In this project, I’m not necessarily going to try and root out the cause, but rather examine the state of MNPS as it is. My main question, “How do student demographics correlate with academic achievement in Metro Nashville Public Schools?”, will be supported by inquiries into MNPS’s demographic distribution by location, correlations between demographics and assessment data, demographic trends over time, and the influence of the school environment.

# Motivation
*Here you will go into more detail about why you have chosen this project.*

My Master’s thesis included an investigation into reading growth differences between students who qualify for free/reduced meals based on income and those who do not. Socioeconomic status (SES) is known to be a significant predictor of educational outcomes, as well as affecting physical and mental health. The causes of this disadvantage are multi-faceted, but include both environmental/family and physical/health considerations.

Another critical aspect is the ongoing segregation within Nashville schools. MNPS never fully desegregated, and as a result, schools have been gradually resegregating over time. This trend reflects persistent societal challenges and historical inequalities, impacting educational opportunities for students across different demographics within Metro Nashville Public Schools (MNPS).

Understanding the impact of demographic disparities on academic outcomes is crucial for addressing systemic barriers to student achievement and fostering a more equitable learning environment. By examining how student demographics correlate with academic achievement in MNPS, this project aims to contribute valuable insights to enhance educational equity and inform evidence-based interventions to support student success.

# Data Question
*Present your question. Feel free to include any research/articles that are relevant or show where others have attempted to answer this question.*

**How do student demographics correlate with academic achievement in Metro Nashville Public Schools?**

- What is the demographic composition (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) of students within Metro Nashville Public Schools?
- Are there disparities in academic performance between students from different racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds?
- Have there been any notable changes in academic achievement trends among various demographic groups over recent years?
- Are there correlations between student demographics and factors like teacher-student ratio or access to resources?

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
*Define your MVP. This should be a description of what your final capstone will look like, including visualizations, how the analysis will be presented, who the intended audience is, etc.*

I will present a Tableau story guiding the audience through the sections of my analysis.

# Schedule (through <date of demo day>)
1. Get the Data (6/2)
2. Clean & Explore the Data (6/9)
3. Create Presentation of your Analysis (6/16)
   - Should be a presentation, but could include a Jupyter Notebook or dashboard in Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI
4. Internal demos (6/20)
5. Demo Day!! (6/27)

# Data Sources
*Document the data you use and the source of that data*

This link contains 4 tabs. I plan on using the data under the Enrollment/Demographics Data tab (most likely multiple years worth) and the Student Assessment Data tab. [MNPS Open Data](https://mnps.org/about/communications/opendata)

I may also use the Nashville zipcodes geodata.
