# Bridging the Gap: Analyzing Equity in Metro Nashville Public Schools

## Motivation
I've been a teacher at a Title 1 MNPS school for six years. My experience gives me insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of MNPS. 

One critical issue is the ongoing segregation within Nashville schools. MNPS never fully desegregated, and schools have gradually resegregated over time, reflecting persistent societal challenges and historical inequalities. This impacts educational opportunities across different demographics. 

Additionally, my Masterâ€™s thesis investigated reading growth differences among low-income students, highlighting how socioeconomic status (SES) significantly predicts educational outcomes and affects physical and mental health. Understanding these demographic disparities is crucial for addressing systemic barriers to student achievement and fostering a more equitable learning environment.


## Questions
**How do student demographics correlate with academic achievement in Metro Nashville Public Schools?**
- What is the demographic composition (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) of students within Metro Nashville Public Schools?
- Are there disparities in academic performance between students from different racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds?
- Are there correlations between student demographics and factors like teacher-student ratio or access to resources?
